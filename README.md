# üè† SubletTinder

# Milestone 1
## Where to find C2 and C3
The SQL code we used for creating our tables is under the path `STBackend/database_setup/SQLQueries/`. You can also find the SQL queries for our 4 basic features in this directory, along with the corresponding output.

## How to create/load the sample database
Our database is hosted on the cloud using Neon, simply follow the steps below to run a local backend server which will automatically connect you to the database.

## How to generate "production" dataset and load into database
Production dataset is in `STBackend/data/prod.xlsx`, data is to be loaded in Neon database through `STBackend/data/insert_data.ipynb`

## üí° Current Features
- Add a listing
- View details of a listing

These two features have currently been connected to our backend and can be tested via an endpoint. See below on how to run a local server and test the features.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to run the backend
1. Clone the repo into your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/jessicaxu0605/SubletTinder.git
```

2. Navigate into the STBackend directory.
```
cd SubletTinder/STBackend
```

3. (Optional) Make a virtual env and activate it
```
python -m venv venv
```
   Mac: `source venv/bin/activate`
   
   Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`

4. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Create an environment (.env) file in the STBackend directory. Inside it should have the following:
```
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url // copy and paste here from the Milestone 1 report
```

6. To test the features:
- Run `uvicorn server:app --reload` 
- Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` in your browser. This will open up the Swagger UI which is used as an interactive interface to test endpoints.

7. You will see two HTTP endpoints, GET and POST, for retrieving listing details and adding a listing respectively. You can test each out by opening a section and clicking **Try it out**
